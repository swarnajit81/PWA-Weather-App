Progressive Web App provides a unique opportunity to deliver a web experience your users will love. Using the latest web features to bring native-like capabilities and reliability, Progressive Web Apps allow what we build to be installed by anyone, anywhere, on any device with a single codebase. This repo explores some Progressive Web App techniques to build a weather app using React.js , axios, lighthouse , and ServicreWorkers.

## Open Weather Map Api

## Service Workers

A service worker is a fundamental part of a progressive web app. It is a JavaScript file that runs on a separate thread from the webpage and can be used to do such tasks as take control of network requests, modify them, and serve custom responses from the cache. The Service Worker lifecycle consists of the following stages:

Registration: If supported, it tells your browser where the service worker is located and to start installing it in the background
Instillation: Triggers an install event where we can run some tasks when the service worker is installed
Activation: Deletes any files that are no longer necessary and cleans up


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
